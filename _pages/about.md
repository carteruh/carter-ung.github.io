Welcome to my homepage! Here are some quick facts about me:

üßë‚Äçüéì I am a 5th year undergraduate student at the **University of Houston**.

üßë‚Äçüíª I am finishing my Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering bachelors and intend to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science after graduation. 

üì∏ My research interests are in computer vision spanning **3D vision, scene representation, perception, and generative approaches**. 

ü¶æ I am very passionate about AI vision applications to robotics, accessibility, and health.

## Experience and Research Work
As an undergraduate, I have participated in over 3 years of research work ranging from brain-machine interfaces, computer vision, and robotics. Currently, I am a research assistant in the **UH Quantitative Imaging Lab (QIL)** advised by **Dr. Shishir Shah** where I am working on pose and resolution factors in **face recognition**. I also work as a research assistant at the **University of Washington** in the **Personal Robotics Lab** mentored by Doctoral Candidate Helen Wang and under supervision by Siddhartha Srinivasa and Dieter Fox. At UW, I actively investigate the development of digital twin technology for **3D articulated objects** for policy learning in simulation and transferred to real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

For work experience, I have spent my past three summers as a **software engineering intern** at **Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, and Northrop Grumman**. I was able to work on advanced computer science concepts such as statistical machine learning (clustering), full-stack web development, cybersecurity, and computer networking. 

May you have any questions or interest in collaboration please reach out to me at **ctung AT uh DOT edu**.

[Minimizing Number of Poses for Pose-invariant Face Recognition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qm7FTqxCNTHF6C2OSZdDEVCh4CDFTgV4/view?usp=sharing)

**Carter Ung**, Pranav Mantini, Shishir Shah

- We introduce an empirical study that address data collection bottlenecks in practical face recognition systems. By studying the effect of model performance across varying pose sets, we infer the minimal number of poses to train and enroll in a face recognition system to achieve pose-invariant capability with less redundancy in data collection efforts.
