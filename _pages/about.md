Welcome to my homepage! I am a 5th year undegraduate student at the University of Houston studying Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering. I intend to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science with concentrations in computer vision research. 

As an undergraduate, I have participated in over 3 years of research work ranging fron brain-machine interfaces, computer vision, and robotics. Currently, I am a research assistant in the UH Quantitative Imaging Lab (QIL) advised by Dr. Shishir Shah where I am working on pose and resolution factors in face recognition. I also work as a research assistant at the Unviersity of Washington in the Personal Robotics Lab mentored by Doctoral Candidate Helen Wang and under supervision by Siddhartha Srinivasa and Dieter Fox. At UW, I actively investigate the development of digital twin technology for 3D articulated objects for policy learning in simulation and transferred to real-world tasks.

For work experience, I have spent my past three summers as a software engineering intern at Nothrop Grumman, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft. I was able to work on advanced computer science concepts such as statistical machine learning (clustering), full-stack web development, cybersecurity, and networking within industry. 

May you have any questions or interest in collaboration please reach out to me at **ctung AT uh DOT edu**.
